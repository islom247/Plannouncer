# PostEr
[PostEr](https://react-firebase-tutorial-f7.firebaseapp.com/) is a simple web application where you can share your ideas,<br/>
experiences, confessions and whatever else that comes to your mind in text format(for now :]).<br/>
(Kinda reminds you of twitter ngl)<br/>
There is a catch though: ***You can see everyone's posts*** (*But hey, you can operate anonymously too*)
### Motivation ###
I created this application for learning **React&Redux** and<br/>
while doing so I also wanted to create something meaningful and fun.<br/>
Along the way I also had the opportunity to gain some knowledge about **Firebase**.

### The following tools and technologies were used to create the application:  ###
* **React and Redux**  for front-end  
* **Cloud Firestore** for database (back-end)  
* **Firebase** for cloud functions and deployment (back-end)
* **Materialize CSS** for styling
